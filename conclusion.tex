\section*{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

I look forward to continuing my research as a PhD student.
I have mentioned some of the problems that have intrigued me,
and I hope to continue to work on them, as well as new interesting problems.
I am excited to formulate new ideas through interactions with students and faculty at your institute,
which will allow me to broaden my reasearch interests beyond what I currently know.
This will allow me to pursue my interests in academia.
