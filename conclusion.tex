\section*{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

I look forward to continuing my research as a PhD student.
I hope to continue to work on the topics that I have already started working on,
but I will also be looking out for new interesting problems in related areas.
I am excited to formulate new ideas through interactions with students and faculty at your institute,
which will allow me to broaden my research horizons and expose me to new topics and new problems.
I am looking forward to an enriching academic experience that will allow me to pursue my academic career.
