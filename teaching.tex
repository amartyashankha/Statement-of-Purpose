\section{Teaching}
I enjoy teaching, and greatly appreciate its importance for being academically active and doing research.
In addition to solidifying my own understanding of the material, teaching a topic is also a wonderful exercise in communication.
After all, the most novel of ideas is useless one can communicate it effectively.

\paragraph{Teaching Assistant}
\label{par:teaching_assistant}
My first teaching experience was in sophomore year, when I was a TA for the second level algorithms course at MIT.
This happened to be the semester when the course was being recorded for MIT Open Courseware.
So, the videos of my recitation were recorded, and posted on the OCW website (recitations $\{2,6,8,9\}$

This was my also first teaching experience, and I found that
I thoroughly enjoyed the process of preparing material, and teaching a class.
I have since been a TA for this class three times, and every offering has contributed to further my understanding of the material.

\paragraph{Independent Teaching}
\label{par:independent_teaching}
I have also undertaken several independent teaching related activities.
During my Junior year, I designed and taught a month-long algorithms course at MIT, with 40 students.
Last summer, I started a workshop for high school students in my hometown in India.
During this three-week intensive workshop, the participants learned C programming,
basic simulations, and completed a hands-on robotics project.
